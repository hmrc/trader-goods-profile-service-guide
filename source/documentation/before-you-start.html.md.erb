To use Trader Goods Profile (TGP), the trader responsible for moving the goods must have a registered account with HMRC. TGP is part of the Customs Declaration Service (CDS) so traders must be subscribed to CDS.

As a software provider, you should share the following guidance with users of your service.

> ## Requirements to use TGP
> Your business must register for a Government Gateway or One Login that will allow you to access TGP using your software.
>
> The business moving the goods must be subscribed to the Customs Declaration Service (CDS).
>
> If your business does not have a Government Gateway or One Login for customs services, you can find out about [signing up for HMRC online services][hmrc-online].
>
> Your business will also need a GB or XI EORI number. You will be given an EORI number when setting up CDS.
>
> ### Registering to TGP
> Your business will need their Government Gateway or One Login user ID to register for TGP.
>
> When your business registers, TGP will check your user ID and ask you for your businessâ€™ UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS) number.

## Authority for your software to act on behalf of your users

All endpoints in the Trader Goods Profile API are user-restricted. Your users must grant authority for your software to access it by signing in using the Government Gateway or One Login user ID that has been registered for the service.

See the [Developer Hub Authorisation documentation][auth-docs] for how users grant authority to your software.
