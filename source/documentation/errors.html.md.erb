# Errors

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
This API is in Beta and may have breaking changes.
</div>

TGP APIs use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not.

They are usually in the range:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SL &num;</th>
    <th>Range</th>
    <th>Scenario</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>200 to 299</td>
    <td>Request succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>400 to 499</td>
    <td> Request failed because of a client error by your application</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>500 to 599</td>
    <td>Request failed because of an error on our server</td>
   </tr>
</table>

Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide][REFERENCE_GUIDE_ERRORS]
for more on errors.

## Sample error structures

All errors from TGP Digital will return a JSON map with two keys: "code" and "message".

### Example error response
```json
{
  "correlationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028",
  "code": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "message": "Bad request",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER",
      "message": "traderRef is not unique for all the provided trader's goods records",
      "errorNumber": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example error response with multiple errors
```json
{
  "correlationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028",
  "code": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "message": "Bad request",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER",
      "message": "traderRef is not unique for all the provided trader's goods records",
      "errorNumber": 10
    },
    {
      "code": "INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER",
      "message": "Mandatory field goodsDescription was missing from body or is in the wrong format",
      "errorNumber": 12
    }
  ]
}
```
