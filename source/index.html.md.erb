# Trader Goods Profile (TGP) Service API overview

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
This API is in Alpha and may have breaking changes.
</div>

Trader Goods Profile (TGP) supports UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS) registered traders moving goods from Great
Britain to Northern Ireland that are not-at-risk of moving into the European Union.

TGP is accessible to traders and authorised intermediaries through an API. TGP will store goods information allowing
traders or intermediaries to use the information to create declarations.

TGP will store information about goods being moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and can be queried via
the TGP API to help populate the H8 dataset on an Internal Market Movement Information form.

The TGP API should be used alongside the Trade Tariff
[commodities API](https://api.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/the-commodities-api.html) and
[categorisation API](https://api.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/green-lanes.html) to retrieve
and store information that is relevant to the goods movement.

The TGP API is in development and specifications for additional endpoints will be published in the coming weeks.
A test environment will also be made available in the near future.

## TGP API overview

The TGP APl uses REST principles with endpoints. The endpoints return data in JSON format and uses standard HTTP error response codes.

Your users can use the TGP APIs to:

- create a TGP record
- update a TGP record
- remove a TGP record
- get TGP records
